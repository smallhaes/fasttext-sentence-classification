    "# Using a Trained Model for Batch Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to make predictions on large quantities of data asynchronously using the ML pipelines with Azure Machine Learning. Batch inference (or batch scoring) provides cost-effective inference, with unparalleled throughput for asynchronous applications. Batch prediction pipelines can scale to perform inference on terabytes of production data. Batch prediction is optimized for high throughput, fire-and-forget predictions for a large collection of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**\n",
    "The dataset we use is not that huge. We aim to make you know the workflow of batch inference. If your system requires low-latency processing (to process a single document or small set of documents quickly), please use realtime inference. Refer to fasttext_realtime_inference.ipynb for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of this notebook is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a DataStore referencing documents stored in a blob container.\n",
    "- Reference a trained fastText model from a complete experiment.\n",
    "- Use the fastText model to do batch inference on the documents in the data blob container.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "If you are using an Azure Machine Learning Notebook VM, you are all set. Otherwise, make sure you go through the configuration Notebook located at https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks first. This sets you up with a working config file that has information on your workspace, subscription id, etc."
